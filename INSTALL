You should compile fsdump with a decently up-to-date Vala Compiler (valac),
which is available at git://git.gnome.org/vala

Many Distribution already offer a version of the Vala Compiler, but this
version probably is super outdated.

If you use Ubuntu you can add a Vala ppa:
ppa:vala-team/ppa
(The package you need is called valac)


If you have all dependencies installed, install with:
	$make
	$make install
